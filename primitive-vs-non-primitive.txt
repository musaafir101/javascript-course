primitive data types

number
bool
string

are primitive data types
what if we assign num1 to num2 
these types save in memory in a stack formate like one by one. 
these types has there own memory location in a stack separatly.

if we change num1 then arr2 will not be changed

Non - Primitive or Reference data types

array
object

are the Non - Primitive or Reference data types
what if we assign arr1 to arr2 
arrays are store in "HEAP" and there address store in stack by pointers
when we assign arr1 to arr2 so arr1 pointer points the array which created at the first time
then arr2 array is assigned arr1 so arr2 pointer points the same array which was create at the first time

if we change arr1 then automatically arr2 will be changed

cloning arrays

let arr1 = ["Item1","Item2"]
let arr2 = arr1.slice(0) // this is faster then the rest // new array created in heap separatly
let arr2 = [].concat(arr1) // new array created in heap separatly
let arr2 = [ ...arr1 ] // new array created in heap separatly

add new items in array

let arr2 = arr1.slice(0).concat(["Item3","Item4"])
let arr2 = [].concat(arr1,["Item3","Item4"])
let arr2 = [ ...arr1,"Item3","Item4" ]
